   ![Aliyun MySQL Connection](../../images/aliyun_mysql_connection_settings.png)

   * **Connection Information Settings**
      * **Name**: Fill in a meaningful and unique name.
      * **Type**: Supports both source and target databases.
      * **Host**: Database connection address, the external network connection address you obtained during the preparation.
      * **Port**: Database service port, default is **3306**.
      * **Database**: Database name, each connection corresponds to a database. If there are multiple databases, you need to create multiple data connections.
      * **Account**: Fill in the Privileged Account name.
      * **Password**: Password corresponding to the database account.
      * **Connection parameter string**: Additional connection parameters, default empty.
      
   * **Advanced Settings**
      * **Time Zone**: By default, TapData Cloud utilizes the time zone used by the database. However, you also have the flexibility to manually specify the time zone based on your business requirements.
        For instance, let's consider a scenario where the source database operates in the default database time zone (+8:00), while the target database has a specified time zone of +0:00. In this case, if the source database stores a timestamp as **2020-01-01 16:00:00**, the same timestamp will be interpreted as **2020-01-01 08:00:00** in the target database due to the time zone conversion.
      * **Contain Tables**: The default option is **All**, which includes all tables. Alternatively, you can select **Custom** and manually specify the desired tables by separating their names with commas (,).
      * **Exclude Tables**: Once the switch is enabled, you have the option to specify tables to be excluded. You can do this by listing the table names separated by commas (,) in case there are multiple tables to be excluded.
      * **Agent Settings**: Defaults to **Platform automatic allocation**, you can also manually specify an agent.
      * **Model Loading Frequency**: If there are less than 10,000 models in the data source, their information will be updated every hour. But if the number of models exceeds 10,000, the refresh will take place daily at the time you have specified.
      * **Enable Heartbeat Table**: This switch is supported when the connection type is set as the **Source&Target** or **Source**. TapData Cloud will generate a table named **tapdata_heartbeat_table** in the source database, which is used to monitor the source database connection and task health.
        :::tip
        After referencing and starting the data replication/development task, the heartbeat task will be activated. At this point, you can click **View heartbeat task** to monitor the task.
        :::

6. Click **Test**, and when passed, click **Save**.
   :::tip
   If the connection test fails, follow the prompts on the page to fix it.
