## <span id="prerequisite">Prerequisites</span>

1. Log in to the openGauss database and execute the following command to create an account for data synchronization/development tasks.

   ```sql
   CREATE USER username PASSWORD 'password';
   ```

   * **username**: The username.
   * **password**: The password.

2. Grant permissions to the newly created account. Here is a simple example, but it's recommended to set more fine-grained permissions based on your business needs.

   For granting permissions as a source:

   ```sql
   GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA schemaname TO username;
   ```

   For granting permissions as a target:

   ```sql
   GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA schemaname TO username;
   ```

      * **schemaname**: The schema name that the target table belongs to.
      * **username**: The username.
