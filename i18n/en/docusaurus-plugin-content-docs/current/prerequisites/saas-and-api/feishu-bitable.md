# Feishu Bitable

[Feishu Bitable](https://open.feishu.cn/document/server-docs/docs/bitable-v1/bitable-overview) (also known as Lark Bitable) is a collaborative spreadsheet tool designed for managing structured data. Tapdata supports integrating it as both a source and target, enabling real-time extraction of table data and synchronization to target databases, search engines, or data lakes. This helps enterprises unify data governance, enhance data usability, and supports use cases such as BI reporting, automation workflows, and real-time analytics.

## Considerations

Feishu Open Platform enforces different rate limiting strategies for different OpenAPI endpoints to ensure system stability and provide optimal performance and developer experience:

- **Batch Insert/Update APIs**: Up to 50 requests per second; each request can contain up to 1,000 records.
- **Batch Delete API**: Up to 50 requests per second; each request can contain up to 500 records.
- **Batch Query API**: Up to 20 requests per second.
    - For tables with a **single primary key**, up to 50 records can be retrieved per request.
    - For **composite primary keys**, only 10 records per request are supported.

For more details, see [Rate Limiting Policy](https://open.feishu.cn/document/server-docs/api-call-guide/frequency-control).

## Supported Sync Operations

DML operations: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

:::tip

When Feishu Bitable is used as a **target**, you can configure data write policies in the task nodeâ€™s advanced settings:

- For **insert events**: Choose to update if the record exists, discard it, or insert only.
- For **update events**: Choose to discard if the record doesn't exist, or insert instead.
