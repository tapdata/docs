# Lark-IM

Lark is an enterprise collaboration and management platform that integrates instant messaging, audio and video conferencing, and open applications. By configuring **Lark-IM (Lark chat messages)** as a target in Tapdata, you can push alert events, operational metrics, or custom notifications from data pipelines to Lark in real time, enabling real-time alerting, automated collaboration, and decision support for your teams.

## Consideration

- To avoid overwhelming users with frequent messages, the sending rate is limited to **5 QPS per user** and **5 QPS shared across bots in a group**.

- The maximum size for a text message request body is **150 KB**, and the maximum size for a card or rich text message request body is **30 KB**.

- Typically, upstream sources (such as databases or logs) do not produce data in the message body structure required by Lark.
  Therefore, you usually need to add a JavaScript or Python processing node in the data pipeline to clean and format the raw data into a JSON structure like the one below:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "receiveType": "{{user | email | phone | chat}}",
      "receiveId": "{{user_open_id | user_email | user_phone | chat_id}}",
      "contentType": "text",
      "content": "{\"text\":\"Hello! This is lark message! \"}"
    }
  ]
  ```

4. [Set the app availability scope](https://open.feishu.cn/document/develop-process/test-and-release-app/availability) to ensure that the target users or groups for Lark messages are within the appâ€™s visible range to avoid message delivery failures.

5. Enable the [Bot capability](https://open.feishu.cn/document/faq/trouble-shooting/how-to-enable-bot-ability) for the application. Note that bot capabilities only take effect after the app is published.
