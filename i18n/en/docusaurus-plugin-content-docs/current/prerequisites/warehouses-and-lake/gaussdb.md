# GaussDB (DWS)

GaussDB (DWS) is a fully managed, enterprise-grade cloud data warehouse service offering zero-maintenance, online scaling, and efficient multi-source data loading capabilities. It is compatible with the PostgreSQL ecosystem. TapData supports using GaussDB (DWS) as both a source and a target, enabling you to quickly build data pipelines. This guide explains how to connect GaussDB (DWS) in the TapData platform.

## SQL Operations for Sync

* **DML**: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
* **DDL** (supported only as a **target**): ADD COLUMN, CHANGE COLUMN, DROP COLUMN, RENAME COLUMN

:::tip

* As a source, incremental data synchronization is achieved via field polling, and DDL operations are not supported. See [Change Data Capture (CDC)](../../introduction/change-data-capture-mechanism.md) for more details.
* As a target, advanced configuration options allow you to set DML conflict handling strategies. For example, you can choose to update or discard on insert conflicts and choose to insert or log errors on update failures.

:::

## Limitations

- When using GaussDB (DWS) in a cluster architecture as the source for incremental synchronization, high availability for CDC is not yet supported. If a primary node switchover occurs, incremental sync may experience errors or interruptions.
- When synchronizing tables without primary keys to GaussDB (DWS), you must disable unique index constraints for update conditions to avoid table creation failures.
- By default, GaussDB (DWS) uses primary keys as distribution columns. Manually specified distribution columns must be included in the primary key, unique index, or update condition, or table creation will fail.
- If the source performs unsupported operations, such as modifying distribution columns, GaussDB (DWS) will convert the update to a **delete followed by insert**. This requires the source update event to include complete `After` data fields. For example, Oracle sources must enable the **complete logging of all fields** feature.

<summary><b>What is the distribution column?</b></summary>

In GaussDB (DWS), distribution columns determine how data is distributed across nodes in a distributed table, impacting query performance. For more details, see [Best Practices for Choosing Distribution Columns](https://support.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/performance-dws/dws_10_0042.html).

## Prerequisites

1. Log in to the GaussDB (DWS) database and execute the following commands to create a user for synchronization or transformation tasks.

   ```sql
   CREATE USER username WITH PASSWORD 'password';
   ```

   - **username**: The user name.
   - **password**: The password.

2. Grant the required permissions to the newly created user.

   ```mdx-code-block
   <Tabs className="unique-tabs">
   <TabItem value="As Source">
   ```

   ```sql
   -- Switch to the database where permissions will be granted
   \c database_name
   
   -- Grant USAGE permission and table read access within the Schema
   GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA schema_name TO username;
   GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA schema_name TO username;
   ```

   </TabItem>

   <TabItem value="As Target">

   ```sql
   -- Switch to the database where permissions will be granted
   \c database_name;
   
   -- Grant USAGE and CREATE permissions for the target Schema
   GRANT CREATE,USAGE ON SCHEMA schemaname TO username;
   
   -- Grant read and write permissions on tables in the target Schema
   GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,TRUNCATE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA schemaname TO username;
   
   -- Grant USAGE permission for the target Schema
   GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA schema_name TO username;
   
   -- Due to GaussDB (DWS) limitations, TapData grants the following permissions for tables without primary keys to ensure updates and deletions work correctly
   -- ALTER TABLE schema_name.table_name REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;  
   ```

   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

   - **database_name**: The database name.
   - **schema_name**: The schema name.
   - **username**: The user name.

## Connect to GaussDB(DWS)

1. Log in to TapData Platform.

2. Click **Connections** in the left navigation bar.

3. Click **Create** on the top-right of the page.

4. Search for and select **GaussDB (DWS)** in the pop-up dialog.

5. Fill in the connection details as follows:

   ![Connecting GaussDB](../../images/connect_gaussdb.png)

   - **Connection Settings**
      - **Name**: Enter a unique and meaningful name.
      - **Connection Type**: Specify whether GaussDB (DWS) is used as a source or a target.
      - **Host**: The database connection address. See [Obtaining the Connection Address of a GaussDB(DWS) Cluster](https://support.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/mgtg-dws/dws_01_0033.html).
      - **Port**: The HTTP API port of the database, which defaults to **8000**.
      - **Database**: The database name. One connection corresponds to one database. Create separate connections for multiple databases.
      - **Schema**: The schema name.
      - **ExtParams**: Optional connection parameters.
      - **User/Password**: The database username and password.
      - **Time Zone**: Default is UTC (0). Non-time-zoned fields (e.g., TIMESTAMP) are affected if changed. Time-zoned fields (e.g., TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE) and DATE are unaffected.
   - **Advanced Settings**
      - **Contain table**: The default option is **All**, which includes all tables. Alternatively, you can select **Custom** and manually specify the desired tables by separating their names with commas (,).
      - **Exclude tables**: Once the switch is enabled, you have the option to specify tables to be excluded. You can do this by listing the table names separated by commas (,) in case there are multiple tables to be excluded.
      - **Agent settings**: Defaults to **Platform automatic allocation**, you can also manually specify an Agent.
      - **Model Load Time**: If fewer than 10,000 schemas, refresh every hour. Otherwise, refresh daily at a specified time.

6. Click **Test** at the bottom of the page. If the test is successful, click **Save**.

   If the test fails, follow the error prompts to resolve the issue.

## Node Advanced Features

When configuring GaussDB (DWS) as a source or target node in a synchronization or transformation task, TapData provides advanced features to optimize performance and meet complex business requirements:

- **Ignore NotNull**: Enabled by default to prevent empty strings from being stored as `NULL` and conflicting with NOT NULL constraints. Disable if empty strings do not need handling.
- **Replace Empty Strings**: Resolves primary key issues with empty strings by replacing them with a specified value.
- **Distribution Columns**: Supports `distribute by hash` for even distribution. Distribution fields must be part of the primary key or update conditions.
- **Enable File Input**: Boosts performance by using file stream imports. Not supported for binary types or conflict scenarios.
